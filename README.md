NeoVim configuration.

## Installation

Clone this repository into `~/.config/` and make sure it's named `nvim`.

```
git clone git@github.com:curtismchale/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

To get telescope working you need to make sure you have `ripgrep` and `fd` installed. You can find [install instructions here for ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [here for fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd).

I use brew on macOS so...
```
brew install ripgrep
brew install fd
```

I'm getting a Fedora machine so...

```
sudo dnf install ripgrep
dnf install fd-find
```
